            <h1>All Thinks Are <br> possible If you <br> believe</h1>

            <p> To believe in something you need to have faith on it. I think that it is impossible to try to do
                something
                <br>
                that
                you donâ€™t put your faith and efforts on it. <br> Maybe you can reach it, but probably it will be
                insufficient
                <br> or
                incomplete. How can you make something really good without efforts? In addition, I think people <br>
                should
                believe
                more in themselves.
